**Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework**
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/azure-well-architected-framework/
This learning path helps prepare you for Exam AZ-305: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions.

**Shared Responsibility Models**
IaaS
PaaS
SaaS

**Cloud models**
The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources
Public cloud
Private cloud
Hybrid Cloud

**Consumption based model**
Capital expenditure (CapEx) 
Operational expenditure (OpEx).

**Azure Arc**
Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment, whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.

**Azure VMware Solution**
What if you’re already established with VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

**High availability**
High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.
99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.9995%

**Scalability**
Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet. Horizontal Scaling & Vertical Scaling

**Reliability**
Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. It's also one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.

**Predictability**
Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability. 



**Performance Predictability** 
Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability 

**Cost predictability**
Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend.  Tools like the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or Pricing Calculator to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.

Benefits of manageability in the cloud
**Management of the cloud**
Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:
  Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
  Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
  Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
  Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.

**Management in the cloud**
Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:
  Through a web portal.
  Using a command line interface.
  Using APIs.
  Using PowerShell.
